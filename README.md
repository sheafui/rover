# Alpine Rover

> **One directive. Ten+ components and use cases. Zero JavaScript required.**

The most powerful and flexible selection system for Alpine.js and Laravel Blade. Build comboboxes, selects, autocompletes, command palettes, tag inputs, and much more with beautiful, declarative HTML.

##  The Why

At SheafUI, we found ourselves rebuilding the same interaction pattern across 10+ different components, selects, command palettes, autocompletes, tag inputs... Each one needed keyboard navigation, search filtering, and state management. **Duplicating this code felt wrong.**

So we're not going to continue ...


##  Features

-  **One Engine, Many Components** - Single directive powers all selection patterns
-  **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard support (arrows, enter, escape, home, end)
-  **Smart Search** - Built-in filtering with performance optimization for large lists
-  **WCAG Accessible** - ARIA-compliant out of the box
-  **Virtual Scrolling** - Handle massive datasets efficiently
-  **Headless** - Complete styling control with Tailwind or custom CSS
-  **Zero Dependencies** - Only requires Alpine.js
-  **Livewire Ready** - First-class Livewire integration
-  **Multiple Modes** - Single select, multi-select, tags, autocomplete, command palette, and more
