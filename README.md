# Alpine Combobox

> **One directive. Ten+ components and use cases. Zero JavaScript required.**

The most powerful and flexible selection system for Alpine.js and Laravel Blade. Build comboboxes, selects, autocompletes, command palettes, tag inputs, and more with beautiful, declarative HTML.

## 🎯 The Why

At SheafUI, we found ourselves rebuilding the same interaction pattern across 10+ different components, selects, command palettes, autocompletes, tag inputs... Each one needed keyboard navigation, search filtering, and state management. **Duplicating this code felt wrong.**

So we're not going to continue ...


## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **One Engine, Many Components** - Single directive powers all selection patterns
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard support (arrows, enter, escape, home, end)
- 🔍 **Smart Search** - Built-in filtering with performance optimization for large lists
- ♿ **WCAG Accessible** - ARIA-compliant out of the box
- 🚀 **Virtual Scrolling** - Handle massive datasets efficiently
- 🎨 **Headless** - Complete styling control with Tailwind or custom CSS
- 📦 **Zero Dependencies** - Only requires Alpine.js
- 🔌 **Livewire Ready** - First-class Livewire integration
